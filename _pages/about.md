I'm a software engineer with a passion for creative problem-solving and innovative development. With a background in both computer science and electronics, I bridge the gap between technical precision and creative intuition. Whether it's designing software, experimenting with electronics, or exploring new creative mediums, I thrive at the intersection of logic and creativity.

# My Journey
My career has been shaped by continuous learning and hands-on experience, from working at HPE to tackling complex personal and collaborative projects. I've built testing frameworks, developed user-centric applications, and explored the boundaries of software and hardware integration. Through these experiences, I've learned that the best solutions emerge from a mix of technical depth, curiosity, and iterative problem-solving.

# What Drives Me
I'm drawn to projects that challenge me to think differentlyâ€”where engineering meets design, and where technology enhances human experience. Whether it's optimizing performance, refining user experience, or building something entirely new, I'm always seeking opportunities to push my boundaries and grow as a developer.
